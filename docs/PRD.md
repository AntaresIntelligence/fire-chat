## 6. Narrative

Sarah, an enterprise customer success manager, starts her day by opening the chat application. She's instantly logged in and sees her conversation history from yesterday's client discussion. She clicks on the ongoing conversation with the product team and continues where she left off - the system remembers the entire context without her having to scroll through previous messages.

When she starts a new conversation about quarterly planning, the AI assistant immediately understands the context and provides relevant insights. Behind the scenes, the system efficiently manages the conversation using Flowise's session management, ensuring fast responses while keeping costs low.

Meanwhile, her IT administrator David has peace of mind knowing that all API keys are securely stored on the backend, conversation data is encrypted, and he has full visibility into system usage through comprehensive audit logs. When the CEO asks about expanding to the European team, David can quickly add new users and configure appropriate access permissions.

The development team can focus on building features instead of managing infrastructure, thanks to Supabase handling authentication, database management, and real-time synchronization automatically.
